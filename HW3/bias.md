### Detection of Biases
In this section, we list papers that observed and studied biases in either static word embeddings or contextualized embeddings.

### Measurement of Biases 
In this section, we list papers that proposed ways/metrics to measure biases. 

### Debiasing Methods 
In this section, we list papers that proposed
methods to mitigate or remove biases in language representations(word embeddings)/language models/NLU, NLG tasks
